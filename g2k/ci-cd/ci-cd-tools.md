> **Description:**  
> `act` is a tool that allows you to run GitHub Actions locally, making it easier to develop and test CI/CD workflows without pushing changes to a remote repository. 
> It supports multiple operating systems via Docker and provides an environment that simulates GitHub Actions, including environment variables and file systems.

> You can also use `act` as an alternative to Makefile by defining tasks in `.github/workflows`.
