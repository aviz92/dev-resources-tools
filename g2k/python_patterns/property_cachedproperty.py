# ðŸ“Œ Principle:
# The Property and CachedProperty patterns are used to define methods that act like attributes (i.e., they can be accessed without parentheses).
# @property: The full_name method is defined as a property. It can be accessed as if it were an attribute (emp.full_name), but it actually calls a method behind the scenes.
# @cached_property: The annual_salary method is defined as a cached property. Itâ€™s computed once and then cached for future access, avoiding redundant calculations.
# These patterns help keep the code clean and allow for the logic to be abstracted away, treating computed values as if they were simple attributes.
